 * A simple factory contract for creating Loyalty Cards. 
 * A near copy of the standard SimpleAccountFactory, except that create cards register the program that created them. 
 * This enables cards to be restricted to only calling functions on their parent loyaltyProgram contract. 
 * -- original text: -- 
 * A UserOperations "initCode" holds the address of the factory, and a method call (to createAccount, in this sample factory).
 * The factory's createAccount returns the target account address even if it is already installed.
 * This way, the entryPoint.getSenderAddress() can be called either before or after the account is created.
